# v0.2 Updated patterns

I have looked closely on the scale of the patterns. They've turned up to be bigger around 15%.

Now I have changed how patterns are collected. It's possible to get the precise angle between two points of the trail in game with `+cl_showpos 1`. After that angle is converted to pixels<sup>[source](http://vergeofapathy.com/mouse-sensitivity-apex/)</sup>. 

I have also found, by trying to compensate with different scopes and FOV from 70 to 110, that recoil is absolute and does not scale with ADS or FOV.

Double checked that new patterns match 1:1 with the game.
